# Product Management App

## Overview
The Product Management App is a web application built using React and Django REST framework. It allows users to manage a list of products, including viewing, adding, editing, and deleting products. The app supports multiple product categories and uses user authentication for managing products.

I made this app to get to know Django REST framework better and learn how to make it work with React.
This was initially only a branch on my repository OPG-app that I made for for job evaluation process but eventually made whole new project.

## Features
View Products: Display a list of products with their details.
Add Product: Add a new product with a category, name, and detail.
Edit Product: Edit the details of an existing product.
Delete Product: Remove a product from the list.
User Authentication: Authenticate users to manage products.
