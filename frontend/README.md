# Description

It is written in React 18.2 in order to replace Django's frontend and enhance user experience.
Current design is the very simple one where I focused on the functionalities instead of design which will eventually need to be improved.

You can register, login as well as add products, edit, delete or simply see product details.

## Getting started with the Frontend
- In order to run Frontend open new terminal and navigate to the frontend.
- run `npm build`
- when it is done, run `npm start`
